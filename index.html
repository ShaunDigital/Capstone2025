    <section id="about">
      <h2 class="section-title">Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        AIME (AI Mental Health Assistant) is a concept app designed to help
        users manage anxiety and panic attacks through a blend of AI-driven
        conversation and biometric awareness. It explores how emerging
        technologies can provide fast, personalized, and stigma-free mental
        health support—right from your phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project goal is to develop a near-development-ready app prototype
        using Figma, supported by motion design and a process website. The app’s
        features include an AI chatbot to guide users through calming exercises,
        a free chat experience, wearable integration, and custom treatment path
        suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
        AIME is born out of both personal experience and curiosity: I’ve seen
        firsthand how anxiety can spiral when left unchecked—and how powerful it
        is to have tools that respond in the moment. I also regularly use AI in
        my daily life and believe it has massive potential for meaningful impact
        beyond convenience. This project asks the question: What if the tech
        that helps you pick a stock or write an email could also help save
        someone’s day—or life?
      </p>
      <p>
        The 10-week build focuses on UX design, prototyping, branding, motion
        graphics, and storytelling. Tools include Figma, Adobe Creative Suite,
        Visual Studio Code, and good old pen & paper. I’m using this opportunity
        to sharpen my existing skills and develop new ones, all while pushing
        toward a portfolio piece I’m genuinely proud of.

      <h2 class="section-title">Research</h2>
      <p>
        Research included analysis of mental health apps like Calm, ADA, Wysa<a
          href="#wysa2023"
          class="footnote"
          >[1]</a
        >, and Youper. Interviews and feedback are planned with users and
        professionals to refine the app experience.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-title">Research Summary</h3>
      <p>
        According to the World Health Organization, anxiety affects more than
        300 million people worldwide<a href="#who2023" class="footnote">[2]</a>,
        yet access to effective treatment remains limited. Whether based on
        income or social stigma, many do not get the help they need to deal with
        this issue properly. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been widely
        recognized by organizations like the ADAA<a
          href="#adaa2022"
          class="footnote"
          >[3]</a
        >
        for helping individuals manage symptoms through practical exercises like
        breathing, journaling, and thought restructuring. However, the issue
        persists, and without help many will continue to suffer. Anxiety most
        often affects young adults, particularly women, and is most prevalent in
        high-income countries—but those in low-income regions are least likely
        to receive help<a href="#nimh2022" class="footnote">[4]</a>. AIME aims
        to close this accessibility gap with guided, evidence-based tools at no
        cost to users.
      </p>

      <p>
        New technologies have begun to fill that gap. Apps like MindShift<a
          href="#mindshift2020"
          class="footnote"
          >[5]</a
        >
        and Wysa<a href="#wysa2023" class="footnote">[1]</a> use CBT frameworks
        and AI chatbots to guide users through mental health exercises. Others,
        like Breathhh<a href="#breathhh2023" class="footnote">[6]</a>, integrate
        smart device sensors to tailor breathing interventions based on
        biofeedback. These tools align with the vision of AIME: a process
        platform that offers structured, self-guided treatments while respecting
        the user’s autonomy and privacy. AIME aims to blend the strengths of
        digital mental health with human connection, avoiding pitfalls like AI
        over-dependence or emotional isolation.

    <section id="design">
      <h2 class="section-title">Design Process</h2>
      <p>
        The design of AIME started with low-fidelity wireframes and sketches to
        explore flow and function in Design Studio last summer. These early
        concepts were done with pen and paper, helping to clarify the user
        journey before moving to digital tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, designs were brought into Figma, where I developed color
        palettes, typography, and a layout system focused on calm, clarity, and
        accessibility. The aesthetic choices aim to support a soothing,
        low-friction experience for users dealing with anxiety and panic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are selected screenshots from different phases of the UI design
        process in Figma, showing progression from early mockups to more
        polished screens.

        This project helped deepen my skills in UX design and allowed me to
        explore how AI can positively impact mental health. I learned to balance
        user needs, aesthetics, and feasibility in a complex space. This project
        was condensed into a 10 week summer class. This is a culmination of all
        of my classes during this program at MCAD.
